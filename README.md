-----NOTES-----

 * Project Phase 3 is located in WebContent/reports. /reports does not contain all the reports, please check WebContent/reports.

 * The project was done via Eclipse. As a result, we decided to commit the whole "WebContent" folder, which contains the index.jsp in WebContent/ and the remaining jsp files will be in WebContent/templates.

 * The SQL file provided in DB_table_declarations includes some insert statements for testing purposes, and no DROPs were added to it as another note.
